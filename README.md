==========

This repository contains small bits of code to play with. Some may turn into
"real" projects, some will die.
The code here has to be considered unstable. It may change at any time and it
may break at any time, too.

strlen
------
Several implementations of strlen - more or less portable, more or less fast.
Some implementations written in C, others in Intel 64-bit Assembly.

brainfuck
---------
A simple [brainfuck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck) interpreter
written in C/Assembly.

takeuchi
--------
A lazy implemantation of the takeuchi function as bash and as perl script. :D
(They are for a memes channel, don't take them serious!)

Memoization
-----------
Some experiments with a function cache in Haskell.

list
----
Some crazy weird haskell stuff... :D
